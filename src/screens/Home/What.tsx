                Healio provides a secure marketplace for verified medical research and Electronic Medical Records (EMR) data.
                It acts as a bridge between individuals, medical researchers and data firms. It facilitates the protection of<b> privacy </b>
                and <b>security</b> concerns of health data of the individuals and gives them complete ownership.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Health research, while necessary, is inefficient and costly. 
                This is mostly because public datasets are not aggregated and key terms are not easily searchable. 
                As much as <b>85%</b> of medical research is redundant, costing us nearly<b> $200 billion </b>annually.
                <br/>
                {/* The only way to get a specific dataset from a scientist is to personally ask researchers. 
                Unfortunately researchers are often reluctant to share their research data because it is highly risky 
                and they are not being compensated. */}
                <br/>
                The privacy and security of health data also poses a large <b>ethical</b> concern. 
                Studies show that more than <b>80%</b> of consumers are willing to share their health data for researchâ€”but 
                it must be private and secure.
                Lastly patients have had little <b>control</b> over their health information. 
                In research, participants are paid for their data but are then separated from any <b>future use</b> of that data.
